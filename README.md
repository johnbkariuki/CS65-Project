We are deeply indebted to mmohades' Venmo wrapper and the Chaquopy Python SDK for Android. We ported code from Chaquopy's chaquopy-console example in this project, specifically in src/main/python/chaquopy and in some files in the directories 'console' and 'utils' in  src/main/java/com/example/checkmate/.
